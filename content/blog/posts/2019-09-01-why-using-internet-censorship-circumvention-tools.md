### Why using Internet Censorship Circumvention Tools

Humans want to be free. Freedom is the most important aspect of their lives and everything they do, even though many people don't understand what freedom entails or how it works.
They live in a society that tells them how to behave and what is acceptable, and punishes those who disobey. This happens from the start of their lives - as soon as they appear, parents influence them constantly.
They are told to go to school, then when they grow up they have work. They're always being watched or judged in some way by others.
They are told what to wear, and how to behave in public. They are punished for doing things that they like but aren't allowed, or even for doing nothing at all.

Circumvention tools designed to bypass online censorship—such as simple web proxies, virtual private network service, and so on—are frequently used in countries whose governments impose heavy Internet censorship
currently using those tools to bypass the Great Firewall and access unblocked online content.
the present study systematically examines a wide range of macro-social and micro-individual factors which affect the use of circumvention tools to bypass Internet censorship under the guidance of the interactive communication technology adoption model.

The Internet censorship circumvention tools are widely used in countries such as China, Iran, Vietnam and other places where people do not have freedom of speech.The Internet censorship circumvention tools are used to avoid internet censorship by bypassing the government imposed barriers. The primary use of these tools is for people living in countries where there is no freedom of speech.

The first is that it makes the government less powerful. If people use circumvention tools and VPNs, they become harder to control. Governments want to keep their citizens under their thumb for many reasons:

The second reason is that most governments are corrupt. They need to keep a lot of secrets from their citizens, otherwise they lose power and control over them. So having people use circumvention tools and VPNs makes it harder for the government to hide its corruption.

So you see, people in authoritarian regimes have a strong incentive to use circumvention tools and VPNs: the government is keeping them under control by force, so their only way of resisting is to use these technologies.

That's why so many people in authoritarian regimes use circumvention tools and VPNs. They have no other way of resisting their government.

as simple:
If you let yourself be exposed to any kind of information, you will be able to make your own decisions. You can see both sides of the story. You can find out what is true and what is a lie. You can learn about the world, and about the people around you. But if you are only exposed to information that someone else wants you to see, then you can't make your own decisions. Someone else is making all of your decisions for you. And that's not good for anyone.
