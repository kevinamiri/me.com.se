### The issue of Internet censorship

Censorship is morally wrong. It's a form of repressing one's own people.
It's a form of oppression, and an attack on the freedom of speech.
It's a form of killing thought, and thus the human spirit.
It's a form of social violence.

The internet is a wonderful tool. It allows them to access information in the palm of their hand, and even communicate with each other from opposite sides of the world, as long as they have an internet connection.

During recent years, I bear witness that anti-censorship tools and VPNs being blocked by AppStore and some western corporations, the question is why? They won't realise the matter of censorship or because of their profits that might be damaged?

For decades, the Chinese Communist Party has been censoring information, In the early stages of recognizing 2019-nCoV (later sars-cov-2) which was known as Wuhan Unknown Pneumonia, they knew about the virus but they didn't tell the public, they censored all the information about it. The efforts of the Chinese Government to hide the virus from the world have been like a really bad game.

In the early stages of the outbreak, companies received official guidance on how to manage virus content. Later on, the government started to ban words related to the virus. The communist party was trying to cover up the severity of the situation, simple censorship but it could prevent thousands of life.

It takes a great deal of courage to tell the truth when nobody else will.Li Wenliang was a hero. When I first read about Li Wenliang, I thought about my own life. I knew that I could never be a doctor like Li Wenliang, but maybe I could do something else to help people.
