### Do circumvention tools promote democratic values?

Circumvention tools are good for promoting democracy and free speech in many ways.
circumvention tools help the oppressed to speak out and spread their message around the world more easily than before. This is very good in promoting free speech and democracy, which are two of our most cherished liberal democratic values.

It promotes freedom of speech in countries where people may not have the right to free speech. For example, in Iran many are oppressed by their government and prevented from speaking out freely. Circumvention tools help these people speak out.
Given that the internet is already a circumvention tool (it allows people to bypass censorhip), it can help promote democratic values and freedom among citizens.

Internet censorship circumvention tools do promote democratic values in Iran, because they allow people to free themselves from the oppression of those who want to limit their ability to access information freely.

When people have access to the information they want, they are able to make informed and intelligent decisions about the issues that impact their lives. This is especially important in a country like Iran where so much of what happens is hidden from public view.
I don't think that access to internet censorship circumvention tools alone is sufficient for promoting democratic values. But when combined with other factors such as free speech, a strong legal system and the presence of an independent press, I think they can go a long way in contributing to democracy.
Internet censorship circumvention tools are just one aspect of the broader struggle for democracy. As long as people have access to information, they can make informed decisions.
