### Privacy

People who have grown up with the internet - who think of themselves as digital natives - are sometimes surprisingly tolerant of censorship and surveillance. They take it for granted that powerful groups will exercise their power to defend their interests, and that ordinary people will be turned into suspects. The young too often assume that human rights are an old-fashioned ideal, consigned to history by the new realities of physical violence and digital trickery.

Privacy, to me is the right for every human being to have a private life. Not in the sense of having no friends or family and living alone but rather that every person should be able to go about their daily business without other people watching them all the time. Privacy gives everybody an opportunity to work on themselves as they see fit and try out their ideas without fear of public ridicule or judgement from others.

Privacy is important because it allows everybody to develop themselves without other people's opinions getting in the way of their decisions. If we don't have privacy then our actions will be controlled by what others think about us and this would prevent us from being able to choose how we want to live.
If we don't have privacy then everybody would be forced to conform and do what the majority thinks is right. This would prevent us from being able to express our individuality and freedom of thought.
Not having privacy would make life very boring as everybody would be forced to do the same thing in the same way. It is only when we have our own space and freedom to do what we want that we can really express ourselves and show who we really are.

Privacy is the foundation of freedom. Without privacy we would all have to go along with the will of others and live our lives according to what they think is good for us.
Privacy allows us to avoid the tyranny of the majority. The actions of a few people should not have control over everybody else.

Privacy is the ability to control your information, and therefore how you are seen by others. It allows for a certain level of freedom from judgement or detection because it gives one the power to choose when and where their private information will be revealed. This can have positive effects such as allowing individuals in society to express themselves freely without being detected/judged. However, privacy has its negative effects as well because it makes people feel that they must hide something wrong with them which could lead to feelings of inferiority or shame.
