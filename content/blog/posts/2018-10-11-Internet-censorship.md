### censorship only fuels the fire of social problems

It's a shame that society is allowing ideas to be oppressed. Not only is censorship immoral, it is also extremely ineffective and often counter-productive. There are many reasons why censorship triggers more social problems than solutions.

Internet Censorship is a complete violation of the human right to free speech. How could anybody even think of restricting such a basic and important freedom? What are they trying to achieve by limiting what people can say? They must be completely insane! I'm sorry but I just cannot find any other plausible explanation for this kind of behavior.

Human right to free speech is a sacred principle which comes from the very core of our human nature. It is part of us – it defines who we are! Therefore, any attempt to restrict this freedom is absolutely evil and should be strongly condemned.

I'm not sure if you are aware but there is a very strong argument that Internet censorship actually leads to more violence and even terrorism. Yes, it does! If people do not have freedom of expression then they will become aggressive and frustrated. And when this happens – look out!

It's not just me who thinks that the Internet is a place of free speech. It has been confirmed by all kinds of studies and reports, which have shown that censorship on the Internet actually leads to more violence and helps terrorism grow.
